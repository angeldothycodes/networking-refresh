# 🌐 What Is a Network?

A network is simply a group of connected computers and devices that can share resources like files, printers, and internet access. These devices communicate using binary code (1s and 0s).

## 🏠 Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN is a network that covers a small geographic area—like a home, office, or department.

**Key points:**

- LANs are faster and more efficient when divided into workgroups (e.g., Sales, Marketing).
- Devices in a LAN are connected using switches or hubs.
- LANs can be connected to each other using a router, which allows communication between different workgroups.

> **Note:** Don’t worry too much about the hardware (switches, hubs, routers) yet—they’re covered in detail in Chapter 5.

## 🔗 Connecting LANs: Routers

When you connect two LANs (like Sales and Marketing), you use a router. This allows:

- Devices in one LAN to access resources in another.
- Better performance and easier management compared to one large LAN.

## 🧠 Key Terms

- **Workstation:** A computer used by an end user.
- **Server:** A computer that provides resources (like files or printers) to other devices.
- **Host:** Any device on a network that has an IP address (includes workstations, servers, printers, etc.).

## 🕸️ Network Topologies, Architectures, and Types

This section is part of the exam objectives and includes:

### 🔄 Topologies

- **Mesh:** Every device connects to every other device. Very reliable but expensive.
- **Star (Hub and Spoke):** All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
- **Hybrid:** A mix of different topologies.
- **Point-to-Point:** A direct connection between two devices.
- **Spine and Leaf:** Common in data centers; ensures high-speed, redundant paths.

## 🏛️ Three-Tier Hierarchical Model

- **Core Layer:** High-speed backbone of the network.
- **Distribution Layer:** Routes traffic between different LANs or VLANs.
- **Access Layer:** Where end devices (like PCs and printers) connect.

## 🚦 Traffic Flows

- **North-South:** Traffic between end users and data centers (vertical).
- **East-West:** Traffic between servers or devices within the same data center (horizontal).

## 📘 Summary
This chapter introduces the basic building blocks of networking:

- What a network is and why it’s important.
- How LANs work and how they’re connected.
- Different network topologies and architectures.
- Key concepts like workgroups, routers, and traffic flow.
