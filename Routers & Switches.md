**First of all, what is a network?**
A **network** is a combination of 2 or more computers that are connected and sharing resources such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or combination of these.


**Discuss switches and router**

To put it simply, routers connect different networks so that devices from one network can communicate with devices from another. Routers are also what allow devices to connect to the Internet.

Switches, on the other hand, connect devices within the same network. For example, the HR department might use Switch 1 to connect all their computers, allowing them to communicate with each other. The IT department would do the same with Switch 2 for their own devices. But if a computer in the IT department needs to communicate with one in the HR department, Switch 1 and Switch 2 would both need to connect to a router. The router handles the communication between the two networks and allows them to exchange data.


**LOCAL AREA NETWORK**

LAN is restricted to a particular geographic lcoation such as an office building, a single department within a corporate office, or even a home office.

Usually a LAN workgroup is created per department- one for Accounting, Sales, IT, etc.
Any device that connects to Accounting LAN can access the resources of the Accounting LAN such as servers and printers.



> You must be physically connected to a workgroup's LAN to get the resources from it.


> You can't get from one LAN to the other LAN and use the server data and printing resources remotely.

You will need to use **router** to connect two or more LANs.

- The host computers from the Sales LAN can communicate to the devices or get the resources (server data) of the Marketing LAN


_ You might think that you can just use a cable to connect two LANS together but that will just be one big workgroup which is not practical today. Smaller, individual-yet-connected groups, the users on each LAN can enjoy much faster response time when accessing resources. Larger workgroups run more slowly because there are lot of devices that are accessing resources at the same time.


TERMS:

**Workstations** are systems used by end user on a daily basis.
**Servers** - "at the service" of the network. Usually dedicated to doing on specific improtant thing within the network. Not always because sometimes they have more than one job.

**Host**- in TCP/IP protocol, host means any devices with an IP address.
