**First of all, what is a network?**
A **network** is a combination of 2 or more computers that are connected and sharing resources such as data and applications, office machines, an Internet connection, or combination of these.


**Discuss switches and router**
To put it simply, routers connect different networks so that devices from one network can communicate with devices from another. Routers are also what allow devices to connect to the Internet.

Switches, on the other hand, connect devices within the same network. For example, the HR department might use Switch 1 to connect all their computers, allowing them to communicate with each other. The IT department would do the same with Switch 2 for their own devices. But if a computer in the IT department needs to communicate with one in the HR department, Switch 1 and Switch 2 would both need to connect to a router. The router handles the communication between the two networks and allows them to exchange data.
